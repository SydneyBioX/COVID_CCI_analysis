# Scalable workflow for characterization of cell-cell communication in COVID-19 patients

Github repository for a generalizable and scalable workflow for cell type annotation, data integration and differential cell cell interaction across COVID-19 patients with distinct disease outcomes. 

The workflow can be generalised to other complex disease. Please check a tutorial on how to apply our framework to other disease using extra melanoma data collection as an example:
